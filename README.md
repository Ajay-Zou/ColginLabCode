# ColginLabCode
Hosting Site for Code Used by the Colgin Lab

The 'GENERAL_LAB_CODE' folder contains code used for many basic operations (e.g., reading in a LFP, spike-time, or coordinates file) as well as other analytical code that isn't particular to any single project (e.g., functions to calculate wavelet power or detect when the rat is in REM sleep). 

The majority of these functions were written or adapted by me (JBT), but several others were downloaded from MATLAB central (e.g., 'rgb') or handed down from generous others (e.g., Joe Manns, Raymond Skjerpeng). Also included are toolboxes we use commonly (e.g., the circular statistics toolbox, the Neuralynx toolbox).  

All functions are thoroughly documented and checked for errors, but please feel free to commit suggestions for review and potential inclusion. 

As this page is developed further, other folders, specific to individual projects, will also be uploaded.

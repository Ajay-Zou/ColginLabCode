# ColginLabCode
Hosting Site for Code Used by the Colgin Lab

The 'GENERAL_LAB_CODE' folder contains code used for many basic operations (e.g., reading in a LFP, spike-time, or coordinates file) as well as other analytical code that isn't particular to any single project (e.g., functions to calculate wavelet power or detect when the rat is in REM sleep). 

The majority of these functions were written or adapted for clarity from the originals by me (JBT), but several others were downloaded from MATLAB central (e.g., 'rgb') or handed down from generous others (e.g., Joseph R. Manns, Moser Laboratory, with permission). Also included are toolboxes we use commonly (e.g., the circular statistics toolbox, the Neuralynx toolbox).  

All functions are thoroughly documented and checked for errors, but please feel free to commit suggestions for review and potential inclusion. If I make any changes that impact functionality, I will notify the lab members. 

If you don't want to use GitHub, code can simply be downloaded as a .zip file. If you choose to use GitHub, an easy to use desktop GUI can be downloaded from: https://desktop.github.com,

As this lab GitHub page is developed further, other folders, specific to individual projects, will also be uploaded. 

The Wiki associated with this GitHub page will also serve as a useful reference for those developing their own code, as it lays out coding standards to be employed across the lab. Tutorials will also be added as soon as possible, with sample code and data to operate on. Common organization and thorough documentation are key to collaboration within the lab, and for the successful handing down of code across 'generations' of lab members.
